/*! \brief Singleton class for loading and retreiving assets

	Provides functions for retreiving pointers to assets such as meshes, textures and shaders.
	Assets are requested by file name. The loader will load these assets the first time they are
	requested and store them in a map with their filename as a key. Then when the same asset is
	requested again it is retreived by this key (so it doesn't get loaded multiple times)
