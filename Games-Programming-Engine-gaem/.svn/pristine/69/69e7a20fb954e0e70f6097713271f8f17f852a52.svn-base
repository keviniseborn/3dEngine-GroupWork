/*! \brief Special Game Object used only by editor to render scene in editor mode

	This special object exists outside of the main engine and is held in the editor class
	It has a camera component that is passed to the render system when the editor is not 
	in play mode, allowing the scene to be rendered through that camera. It is updated only
	when the editor is not in play mode, allowing the user to move the camera with the mouse
	to explore the scene in "edit" mode.
