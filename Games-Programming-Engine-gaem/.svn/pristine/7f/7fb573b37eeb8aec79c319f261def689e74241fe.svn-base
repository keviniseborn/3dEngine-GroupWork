/*! \brief Transform representing position, rotation and scale in 3D space

	A component rather than fundamental property of game object as some
	game objects won't need them (e.g. sound-only, behaviour-only, 2D GUI etc)

	IMPORTANT NOTE: The rotateAround() and lookAt() functions are harder to implement than I
	first thought because matrices need to be decoupled from the 3 vectors for position, euler
	angles and scale. For example, you might want to set position separately from rotation. There needs
	to be a way of converting from the matrix to these 3 vectos and back again.

	The other big problem I encounted was rotation around a point because to get it working intuitvely
	you need to be able to rotate around a relative axis (rather than world axis). This should be solved
	when quaternions are used rather than euler angles but that is beyond the scope of the inital prototype.
	This is an issue for the editor camera, which needs to be able to rotate around it's focus point (and 
	constantly look at it). This is not hard to do with matrices alone but I'm currently unsure of how to update
	the position, rotation and scale vectors to reflect the matrices
